A place to organize my notes and group my thoughts together
very similar to the cookie clicker game and will regularly refer back to the site in order to draw reference and inspiration (if there is enough time maybe try to figure out how to create characters to make donut clicking more efficient)

First things first need to create a website that uses button clicks to create donuts and eventually build up the currency to purchase auto clickers 
Basically just a website version of a idle game 

clicks are a 1:1 with a +1 increment (1 click will move on to 2 clicks etc etc)

Auto clicker will increases by 10% as you buy more auto clickers 


html will have to have a section that handles the clicks as well as a section that deals with auto clicker

the donut maker function will add a donut count for every click AND return a donut count to the display 
check if enough donuts are there to purchase a autoclicker
increase the count (and cost) of autoclickers with each purchase
autoclicker will apply clicks every second based on the auto clicker count
has the option to reset the game when desired 

will treat the iterations as groups and try to work on each iteration in said group before moving to the next one unless it is needed in order to make a part of the code work  

iteration 1 
    Feature 1 have a way to count le donuts
        a way to count donuts 
            can add to and retrieve a donut count

    Feature 2 auto clicker should cost 100 doughnuts 
        can retrieve a autoclicker count as well as adding to the auto clicker count 
        subtract the auto clicker cost from the donut clicker (if you have 500 cookies and a autoclicker cost 300 then you have 200 donuts left )      

    Feature 3 cost of each autoclicker goes up with each purchase (10%)
        also remember to make it so that each additional autoclicker purchases increases by 10%  

    Feature 4 make sure there are enough clicks to buy a autoclicker
        prevent autoclicker from going up if there aren't enough donuts to buy one 

    Feature 5 the amount of autoclickers positively affect the amount of donuts added when an 'Activate auto clickers' even if called 
        increases the total by the mount of auto clickers is owned 
            if a autoclicker triples the amount then the donut total will also triple 

iteration 2 
    Feature 1 give the people a button to click 
        in the main section of the page 
        label the button so nobody has an excuse to misunderstand 

    Feature 2 create a click count element 
        the element will provide the user with the donut count 

    Feature 3 section for the auto clicker 
        section of elements that includes a purchase button and a count of auto clickers 

    Feature 4 header with a link to a drop down element with info about the company
        gotta give the marketing folks their piece of the pie 
    
    Feature 5 header with a link to the inspiration of the game 
        create a link that opens to papa cookie maker

    Feature 6 header with link to drop down element with info about developer
        gotta give credit to myself of course

iteration 3 
    Feature 1 donut counter should change when clicker button is pressed 
        each press should add however many donuts the player is making at the time 

    Feature 2 auto clickers purchase button should be grayed out and unresponsive if there isn't enough donuts to purchase it 
        if you have no money you do not even get the option to pretend to buy something 
        no matter how many times it is pressed, nothing will happen 

    Feature 3 auto clicker count should be displayed 
        user should be able to see what all they have purchased 
        count should update with each purchase that is made 

    Feature 4 auto clicker in clicks should be displayed 
        should know how many donuts is needed to make the next purchase 
            no different than seeing how much money is needed for that cpu upgrade 
        cost should update whenever the price is changed 

iteration 4
    Feature 1 have a way to reset the game 
        for those who want to start over and try a different approach (no idea why but to each their own) in order to be more efficient
            should stay on the same page to (but still reset) in order to keep the transition smooth and seamless 


Things that i might want to try out if I have time to spare and it does not decimate my code
